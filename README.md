# hell0-world
My initial exploration of GitHub
I am a beginning developer. I am interested in Python, Android, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon ecosystems. I would love to empower Christians, and anyone else, to make social progress in cities all over the world. I believe tech is the bicycle of the mind, if used appropriately. I do need to focus and find a role model to help me get into the tech field. Pray for me to helpful and successful.

This hello-world is my demo of getting into this new field.
